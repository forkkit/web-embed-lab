# Collusion

When capturing a web session (usually when running the `auto-formulat` command) the WEL need to capture every request and response made by a browser. To do this it runs an HTTP forward proxy that captures all of the transferred data as well as meta-data about the transfers. This information is then used to "freeze-dry" a web session into a page formula for repeatable use by the `runner` command.
