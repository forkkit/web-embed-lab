# Contribute to the Web Embed Lab

Have you written a test probe that would be useful for other people? Is there a missing feature of the WEL that you'd like to implement? Did you find something confusing and you'd like to fix the documentation? Are you bothered by the lack of unit or functionality tests?

Well, this document is for you!

## Code of conduct

First, read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document. By contributing code to the Web Embed Lab or participating in its fora you implicitely agree to abide by those rules and understand that if you do not then you will be blocked from participation.

## License

All of the WEL source code is licensed under the MIT license, as noted in the [license](../LICENSE) document. All contributions to the WEL repository are covered by that license.

## Style guidelines

Mostly TBD, but in general we use the Go formatter and the Javascript prettifier and linter to solve most questions of syntax.

## Good first bugs and features

Find a small bug in [Issues](/fullstorydev/web-embed-lab/issues) that hasn't been assigned to anyone and **let us know** that you're working on it so you're not accidentally duplicating someone else's effort.

PRs are welcome for new test probes and example files.

It's generally a good idea to start with a small contribution so that you can get to know how the community works. It's disappointing to go off and do a lot of work and find out that it's not on the roadmap or a duplicate of someone else's project. 

File an Issue or command on an existing Issue so we're working together instead of lone wolfing our way to frustration.

If all else fails, contact @TrevorFSmith on GitHub or on Twitter (same handle) and we'll figure it out together.
